		The router is straight-forward and not configurable.  It reads the URL, parsing the query-parameters into an
		object called Lean.state, then parses the hash value which has this format: #component/name:container/ID.  The
		component-name maps diretly to an HTML file which <i>should</i> be of the correct format.  The component's
		template and data are compiled and shoved into a container-node gotten by it's ID attributes.
