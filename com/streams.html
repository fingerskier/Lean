		BaconJS provides the declarative glue that makes Lean work.  While the component-controllers implement data
		retrieval and view setup/teardown Bacon gives us the means to describe behavior.  In Lean there are two sources
		of events: the UI and the Model.  We tell Bacon which event-source to tap and it will attach an event listener
		and output a steady stream of events as they occur...which we can garner and use in a callback function.  These
		streams can be composed in different ways like combinations, mappings, and accumulations.
